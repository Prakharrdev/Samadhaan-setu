## 📖 About The Project

The **Samadhaan Setu** is a modern web application designed to bridge the gap between citizens and local authorities. This platform enables community members to report civic issues, track their resolution status, and actively participate in improving their neighborhoods.

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Citizens often struggle to report civic issues like potholes, broken streetlights, or garbage collection problems to the appropriate authorities. Traditional reporting methods are inefficient, lack transparency, and provide no feedback mechanism.

### 💡 Our Solution
A user-friendly digital platform that streamlines the entire issue reporting process with real-time tracking, automated routing to relevant departments, and transparent status updates.
